  Hey there! I'm Pelumi Aboluwarin, a Software Engineer with a strong entrepreneurial drive. I spend the bulk of my time exploring, learning and building stuff :)!
  My core interest lies in Artificial Intelligence focussing on Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. 

  This blog aims to archive my thoughts on random things relating to tech, entrepreneurship and life.
